SYNOPSIS
      logsaw.pl [-d|--debug] [-?|--help] [-H|--show-filename] [-n|--line-number] [--conf path_to_config_file]

DESCRIPTION
    This program reads a bunch of log files generated by a program and sends
    the interesting messages to stdout. It supports log files rotated and
    optionnaly compressed by logrotate or another similar mecanism.

OPTIONS
    -d, --debug: output some debug informations.
    -?, --help: show this help page.
    -H, --show-filename: show log filenames in the output.
    -n, --line-number: show line number of the entrey in the logfile.
    -f, --conf: configuration file. By default "$HOME/.logsaw".

CONFIGURATION
    The configuration file can these entries :

    * LOGFILES is a regular expression matching every filename we want to
      scrutinize. They have to be in the same directory for instance :
      postgresql-8.4-main-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}.log". By default, match all
      files.

    * LOGDIR is the directory where the LOGFILES are located, eg.
      "/var/log/postgres". By default './'.

    * REGEX is a rule to match for a line to be kept in the result. The
      rules are perl regular expressions. The configuration file can have as
      many REGEX than rules needed. By default, match all line.

    * NOTREGEX is a rule to match for a line to be ignored in the result. 
      The rules are perl regular expressions. The configuration file can have 
      as many REGEX than rules needed. By default, match all lines. If you put 
      REGEX and NOTREGEX at the time in the configuration, both are applied: a 
      line has to match a REGEX and not match any NOTREGEX to be displayed.

    * PAGER give an arbitrary command to open and read log files if IO::Zlib
      is not available. For instance "zcat -f" or "gzip -dfc".

    The next parameters set where to start processing log files on the next
    call of logsaw and are updated by itself. If not set, logsaw will parse
    all matching log files from the begining.

    * FILEID is the cheksum of the last seen file

    * OFFSET is the position in this file

SAMPLE
    The following configuration file will:

    * match any line containing the FATAL, ERROR or WARNING strings

    * against all files in the directory "/var/log/postgres"

    * matching "postgresql\.log" (eg. postgresql.log, postgresql.log.1,
      postgresql.log.2.gz, ...)

    * using "zcat -f" to open files

        LOGDIR=/var/log/postgres
        LOGFILES=postgresql\.log
        PAGER=zcat -f
        REGEX=FATAL
        REGEX=ERROR
        REGEX=WARNING

      Note that on a system with IO::Zlib installed, PAGER is not required.
