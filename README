    Version 1.0

SYNOPSIS
      logsaw.pl [-d|--debug] [-?|--help] [-H|--show-filename] [-n|--line-number] --conf path_to_config_file

DESCRIPTION
    This program reads a bunch of log files generated by a program and sends
    the interesting messages to stdout. It supports log files rotated and
    optionnaly compressed by logrotate or another similar mecanism.

OPTIONS
    -d, --debug: output some debug informations.
    -?, --help: show this help page.
    -H, --show-filename: show log filenames in the output.
    -n, --line-number: show line number of the entrey in the logfile.

CONFIGURATION
    The configuration file contains these mandatory entries :

    * LOGFILES is a regular expression matching every filename we want to
      scrutinize. They have to be in the same directory for instance :
      postgresql-8.4-main-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}.log"

    * LOGDIR is the directory where the LOGFILES are located,
      "/var/log/postgres"

    * REGEX is a rule to match for a line to be kept in the result. The
      rules are perl regular expressions. The configuration file can have as
      many REGEX than rules needed.

    The next parameter is optional :

    * PAGER give an arbitrary command to open and read log files if IO::Zlib
      is not available. For instance "zcat -f" or "gzip -dfc".

    The next parameters are updated everytime the program is run :

    * FILEID is the cheksum of the last seen file

    * OFFSET is the position in this file

SAMPLE
    The following configuration file will:

    * match any line containing the FATAL, ERROR or WARNING strings

    * against all files in the directory "/var/log/postgres"

    * matching "postgresql\.log" (eg. postgresql.log, postgresql.log.1,
      postgresql.log.2.gz, ...)

    * using "zcat -f" to open files

        LOGDIR=/var/log/postgres
        LOGFILES=postgresql\.log
        PAGER=zcat -f
        REGEX=FATAL
        REGEX=ERROR
        REGEX=WARNING

      Note that on a system with IO::Zlib installed, PAGER is not required.
