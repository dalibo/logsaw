logsaw.pl
    logsaw.pl - retrieve and filter your logs

SYNOPSIS
      logsaw.pl [-d|--debug] [-h|--help] --conf path_to_config_file

DESCRIPTION
    This program reads a bunch of log files generated by a program and sends
    the interesting messages to stdout. It supports log files rotated and
    optionnaly compressed by logrotate or another similar mecanism.

Configuration file
    The configuration file contains these mandatory entries :

    * LOGFILES is a regular expression matching every filename we want to
      scrutinize. They have to be in the same directory for instance :
      postgresql-8.4-main-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}.log"

    * LOGDIR is the directory where the LOGFILES are located,
      "/var/log/postgres"

    * REGEX is a rule to match for a line to be kept in the result. The
      rules are perl regular expressions. The configuration file can have as
      many REGEX than rules needed.

    The next parameter is optional :

    * PAGER give an arbitrary command to open and read log files if IO::Zlib
      is not available. For instance "zcat -f" or "gzip -dfc".

    The next parameters are updated everytime the program is run :

    * FILEID is the cheksum of the last seen file

    * OFFSET is the position in this file

Sample configuration file
    The following configuration file will match any line containing the
    FATAL, ERROR or WARNING strings against all files in the directory
    "/var/log/postgres" matching "postgresql\.log" (eg. postgresql.log,
    postgresql.log.1, postgresql.log.2.gz, ...).

      LOGDIR=/var/log/postgres
      LOGFILES=postgresql\.log
      REGEX=FATAL
      REGEX=ERROR
      REGEX=WARNING
