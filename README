SYNOPSIS
      logsaw.pl [-d] --conf path_to_config_file [-h]

DESCRIPTION
    This program reads a bunch of log files generated by a program (and
    rotated by logrotate or another similar mecanism) and sends the
    interesting messages to stdout.

Configuration file
    The configuration file contains these mandatory entries :

    * LOGFILES is a regular expression matching every filename we want to
      scrutinize. They have to be in the same directory for instance :
      postgresql-8.4-main-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}.log"

    * LOGDIR is the directory where the LOGFILES are located,
      "/var/log/postgres"

    * REGEXFILE is a filename containing the rules to match for a line to be
      kept in the result, for instance "/etc/logsaw_filter". The rules are
      perl regular expressions, one per line.

    The next parameter is optional :

    * PAGER give an arbitrary command to open and read log files if IO::Zlib
      is not available.

    The next parameters are updated everytime the program is run :

    * FILEID is the cheksum of the last seen file

    * OFFSET is the position in this file
